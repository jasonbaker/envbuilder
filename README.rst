Envbuilder is a system for automatically building virtualenvs in Python.
To do this, it uses a .env config file to define *parcels*, which are
individual pieces of software to be checked out and installed into
the virtualenv.

It is mainly tested under Linux, but it should work under any platform that
supports unix-y commands (including cygwin).  In fact, you might even be
able to make one config file work on both Windows and \*nix if you're
careful.

Envbuilder has a few goals:

 * **Transparency** - You should understand what your build is doing and
   how it works.
 * **Developer-friendly** - Although envbuilder is perfectly fine for production
   deployment, it is primarily intended to make work environments for developers.
 * **Dynamic** - Envbuilder should be able to work with a variety of technologies,
   languages, and frameworks.  Developers shouldn't be limited to a narrowly defined
   set of technologies.  And neither should their tools!
 * **VCS-neutral** - Envbuilder will work with your shiny new DVCS out of the box.
   In fact, it will work with any VCS that has a command-line interface.  Use it
   with hg, git, bzr, SVN, or CVS (if you're a masochist).
