This is a setup of Shaneal Manek's [trivial-lisp-webapp](http://blog.postabon.com/a-simple-lisp-webapp-for-beginners).

To begin, use the following commands from within this directory:

    envb checkout
    export INSTALL_ROOT=`pwd`
    envb setup
    export SBCL_HOME=`pwd`/lib/sbcl
    envb start

Your web application should be ready!
